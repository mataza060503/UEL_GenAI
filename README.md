Based on your GBus project and your thesis titled **"Building an Information Retrieval System for University Documents Based on Generative AI Technologies"**, here's a tailored README.md draft that reflects the goals, structure, and tech of the UEL Generative AI system. This version uses your original structure but recontextualized for the academic IR system:

# UEL Generative AI Retrieval System

A smart and scalable information retrieval platform designed to improve access to university documents using cutting-edge Generative AI and semantic search technologies.

## Description

This system enables users‚Äîstudents, lecturers, and administrators‚Äîto efficiently search and retrieve academic documents stored at the University of Economics and Law. The platform enhances traditional keyword-based search with semantic understanding, leveraging modern language models to provide contextual, accurate, and helpful responses.

Developed as part of a graduation thesis, the project explores the synergy between Generative AI (e.g., LLMs like GPT) and classical information retrieval models, offering both document listing and answer generation from internal university sources.
